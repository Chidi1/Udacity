# Project 1: Blockchain Identity
In the first project, you’ll learn to create and utilize your own blockchain identity.

You’ll establish your own profile on the blockchain, and interact with a webservice using public and private keys with your own personal bitcoin wallet.

# Project 2: Blockchain Data
In Project 2, you’ll create your own private blockchain. This will help you understand how the blockchain stores data, and what makes it a secure way to manage transactions across so many industries.

# Project 3: Web Services
Project 3 is all about connecting this blockchain to a web service that users can interact with. You’ll build an API web service using NodeJS that allows you to post new blocks, then retrieve and validate existing blocks on your private blockchain.

At this point in the program, you’ll have the skills you need to start crafting your own public service on the blockchain. The remaining projects in the 2nd half of this program are meant to help support you as you do exactly that.

# Project 4: Identity and Notary Service
In project 4, you’ll create an identity and notary service. This service will use the blockchain to securely notarize digital documents without the need for any 3rd party intermediary. You’ll learn to manage user profiles, service and store digital documents, and will begin exploring the different blockchain service layers.

# Project 5: Identity and Smart Contracts
In project 5, you’ll start building smart contracts using ethereum. Ethereum is currently the world’s largest platform for building decentralized applications. Here you’ll jump right in and learn solidity - ethereum’s programming language - and learn the relationship between ethereum, bitcoin, and the blockchain.

# Project 6: Architecture
In project 6, you’ll dive deeper into the lower level components of your notarization web service. This will help you understand some of the lower level details of working with the blockchain - including when to use one, the value it adds to a service, and how to select the right platform for your future decentralized applications.

# Project 7: Supply Chain
In project 7, you’ll continue adding functionality to your notarization service to solve the issue of supply chain management.

This allows your apps users to track product owners from the time it is originally made, up until it reaches the shelves for potential customers.

This was completely unheard of prior to the blockchain, and is at the core of what makes developing decentralized applications so special.

# Project 8: Capstone
The capstone project is the culmination of this Nanodegree program.

It gives you an opportunity to demonstrate everything you’ve learned. It uses aspects from each of the seven preceding projects and challenges you to build a brand new, unique service that uses blockchain technologies.

In this capstone project, you’ll build a web service that solves the supply chain issue in the farming industry.

This decentralized application will allow users to track and manage ownership of resources from the time food is grown, until the time it ends up on the store shelf. This application has the potential to revolutionize the industry making food cheaper and more readily available to people around the world.
